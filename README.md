I completed this projects showcasing my skills in Excel with the help of Luke Barousse's "Excel for Data Analytics" YouTube video (https://youtu.be/pCJ15nGFgVg?si=VyeR3DjywT_Cs24J). Throughout the process I learned not only the basics about Excel such as formulas, charts, and spreadsheets, but also some of the more advanced features of Excel like pivot tables, power query, and power pivot.
